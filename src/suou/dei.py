Legend:
a through z, ' (apostrophe) and - (hyphen/dash) mean what they mean.
? is an unknown symbol or non-ASCII/non-alphabetic character.
+ is a suffix separator (like / but allows for a more compact notation).
/ is the separator.

Except for the presets (see Pronoun.PRESETS below), pronouns expand to the
given notation: e.g. ae+r is ae/aer.
